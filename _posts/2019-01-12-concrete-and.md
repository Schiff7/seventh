# Abstractions

> The data structures (lists, vectors, maps, and sets) are all concrete data types. The various Clojure functions for working on them (which we will get to later on) actually aren't written to work on the concrete types, but rather, are written to work on abstract data types. The concrete data types are implementations of the various abstract data types. —— [Clojure docs](http://clojure-doc.org/articles/tutorials/introduction.html#abstractions)



- Java - interface and class ?
- Haskell - class constraint ?
- C++ - template ?
